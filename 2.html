<p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and styling of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or 
    <br>XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).
    <br>[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]<br>

    CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.<br>
    [3] This separation can improve content accessibility;[further explanation needed] provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; 
    <br>enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .<br>
    css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.</p>
