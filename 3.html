<p>JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/), often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language and core technology of the Web, alongside HTML and CSS.
    <BR> 99% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior.[10]

    Web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine that executes the client code. These engines are also utilized in some servers and a variety of apps.
    <BR> The most popular runtime system for non-browser usage is Node.js.
    
    JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.
    <BR>[11] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles.
    <BR> It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
