<p><strong>Web standards</strong> are the building blocks of a consistent digitally connected world. 
They are implemented in browsers, blogs, search engines, and other software that power our experience on the Web.
</p>

<p>A range of organizations join the World Wide Web Consortium as Members to work with us to drive the direction of core web technologies and exchange ideas with industry 
and research leaders.<br> We rotate randomly a few of our Member organizations' logos underneath.</p>
